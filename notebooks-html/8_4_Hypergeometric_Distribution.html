<li>a population of voters, and among them the group who will vote for a particular candidate</li>
<li>a population of households, and among them the group that have annual incomes below \$50,000</li>
<li>a deck of cards, and the suit of diamonds</li>
</ul>
<p>Let $N = G+B$ where $G$ is the number of good elements and $B$ the remaining number of elements which we will unkindly describe as "bad".</p>

<h3 id="Relation-with-the-Binomial">Relation with the Binomial<a class="anchor-link" href="#Relation-with-the-Binomial">¶</a></h3><p>Suppose you have a population of $N = G+B$ elements as above, and suppose you sample $n$ times <em>with</em> replacement.

<p>If you sample <em>without</em> replacement, then the distribution of the number of good elements is hypergeometric $(N, G, n)$.</p>

<h3 id="Fisher's-Exact-Test">Fisher's Exact Test<a class="anchor-link" href="#Fisher's-Exact-Test">¶</a></h3><p>We will conclude this chapter with a return to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11376175">randomized controlled experiment</a> we analyzed in Data 8. The treatment was the botulinum toxin A, a very potent toxin, in patients who had chronic back pain.</p>
<p>A total of 31 patients participated in the study. Of these, 15 were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the remaining 16 to control. Eight weeks after treatment, 11 of the 15 in the treatment group had pain relief compared to 2 out of 16 in the control group. In other words, of the 13 patients who had pain relief, 11 were in the treatment group and 2 in the control group. Is this evidence in favor of the treatment?</p>
<p>The null hypothesis says that the treatment does nothing; any difference between the two groups is due to the random assignment of patients to treatment and control.</p>
<p>The alternative says that the treatment was beneficial.</p>
<p>To see which of the hypotheses is better supported by the data, we can find a P-value. This is the chance, under the null hypothesis, of getting data like the data that were observed or even more in the direction of the alternative. That is, the P-value is the chance of getting 11 or more of the "pain relief" patients in the treatment group, just by chance.</p>
<p>Under the null hypothesis, the treatment did nothing, so among the 31 patients in the study, <em>13 would have had pain relief anyway</em>, regardless of the assignment to groups. To find the chance that 11 or more of the "pain relief" group would have ended up in the treatment group, we just need a hypergeometric probability:</p>
<ul>
<li>N = 31, the population size</li>
<li>G = 13, the total number of "pain relief" patients</li>
<li>n = 15, the size of the treatment group</li>
<li>g = 11 or more</li>

<p>That's a very small P-value, which implies that the data support the alternative hypothesis more than they support the null. The treatment helped. This is consistent with the conclusion of the researchers and also with our own analysis in Data 8 – but all three analyses are different.</p>
<p>In Data 8 we simulated the difference between the two group proportions under the null hypothesis. Our calculation here does not require simulation and produces an exact one-sided P-value.</p>
<p>This method is called Fisher's exact test. That's the same Sir Ronald Fisher who formalized tests of hypotheses, suggested cutoffs for P-values, and so on. The method can be used for any sample size and any randomized controlled experiment with a binary response.</p></div></div>
